Installation
Follow these steps to install and set up the backend API on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/quadcode-shivam/quad_pulse_ems_backend.git
cd quad_pulse_ems_backend
2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Composer installed. If not, install it from here.

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
composer install
3. Set up the environment
Create a .env file by copying the .env.example file:

bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Update the .env file with your database connection details:

plaintext
Copy code
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=quadpulse_ems
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
Also, set the JWT secret for API authentication:

bash
Copy code
php artisan jwt:secret
4. Run database migrations
Run the following command to create the necessary tables in your database:

bash
Copy code
php artisan migrate
If you need sample data, run the seed command:

bash
Copy code
php artisan db:seed
5. Start the server
Now you can run the Laravel development server:

bash
Copy code
php artisan serve
Your backend API should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Authentication
The API uses JWT Authentication. You will need to authenticate via the /login endpoint to obtain a token, which you can use to access protected routes.

Example Request
1. Login to get JWT Token
Endpoint: POST /api/login

Body:
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password"
}
{
  "access_token": "your-jwt-token-here"
}
